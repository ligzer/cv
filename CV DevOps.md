Responsive – I like help people’s. I’m getting satisfied, when my help make someone life easy.
Empathy – in wide meaning, without splitting to feelings and thoughts. It’s about someone experience of work with me or with results of my work. It’s make me feel very excited, when peoples even on short track begin interact understanding with half-word and not interferencing with each other.
Stress Resistance – peoples say so. To say the truth it’s requires efforts.
Meticulous – I like to find any minor bugs, mistakes, problems and fix or report them.
Self-sufficiency – first I’ll sort out the question or problem and try resolve it by my own.

Some maybe-interesting things I have done in this time: I used linux-based system for mass cloning windows system image. Also multitranslation VNC, as replacement of projector.

2011-2013 Mallina(Reastraunt company)
IT – manager, system and network administrator, developer.
In our it-department was two employees. We serviced six restaurants and one office. Main job is system and network administration, also overhead jobs, episodically programming. We begin using Asterisk, with simple rules, ingtegrated sql and bash scripts for ruling it.

2013-nowadays Noname company

It wasn’t changing of job, just our it-department begun work independently of main restaurant company with other’s clients(different restaurant companies). I replaced bare-metal servers to hypervisors( ESXI, and later Proxmox), configured zabbix. In my tasks, was supporting and developing our infrastructure.
